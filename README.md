# Refactoring Code Challenge
## In this project I was given starter code to modify to follow accessibility standards as well as semantic HTML. After finishing that I had to consolidate and organize CSS selectors and make sure it followed semantic structure as well. Finally with this being my first coding project I needed to make sure that once my site was deployed everything still worked properly and loaded without issue.
## For this project I only used basic HTML and CSS.
